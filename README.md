To run the app: <br>

Step 1: run "npm install" to make sure all dependencies are installed.<br>
Step 2: run the command: <br>
  "npm run start"<br>
from the root folder to start the server.<br>
Step 3: Go to web browser, type in "localhost:3000" as the url <br>
Step 4: Test the app's expected behavior<br>
